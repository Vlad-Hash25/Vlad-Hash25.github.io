/***
 * Fifth revision of this damn file. Trying to learn positioning and margins and shit. Maybe I'll just do a redesign to make this easier.
 * Why can't CSS have single line comments?!
 * Github-pages, I love you. ALso, thanks to whoever the chap was that reviewed my css and said it looked halfway decent.
 *
 * So, let's see what I'm doing here. I'm trying to use dividers and position things. Perhaps I'll even try and make it fit on other devices. Perhaps.
 * W3Schools, you're just as awesome as you are confusing. Thank god I'll not be doing this for a living.
 *
 * Also, I've been using textures from transparenttextures.com. Felt I should probably put that in there.
