        <p>I, Vlad, am a high school student that is looking to go into Information Technology. More specifically, systems administration. Programming is not at all my
           forte, but I do enjoy what little I know. I love gaming, building computers, troubleshooting them, and generally d*cking them over whenever I get the chance.
           I'm also a minor mechanical keyboard enthusiast who hasn't yet managed to get the funds to "invest" in a better keyboard. I am also of the current opinion
            that CSS is bullshit and needs to die.
